Birthday Reminder App

Context
As our business grows bigger, we can no longer use the current way of looking through our excel sheet to find customers' birthdays to send them well wishes. We need to automate this process. 

Your task:
Create a simple UI interface to collect date of births, username and email. No need to collect other information
Every day at 7am, a cron job will run to check your database for whose birthday is today.
Using any free email platform(recommending: gmail with nodemailer), send an email to birthday celebrants. Use any form of well wishes or design for the email.
